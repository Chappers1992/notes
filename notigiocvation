Subject: Action Required: Transition to OpenID-SSO for Artifactory Access

Dear Artifactory Users,

We are reaching out to inform you of an upcoming change to Artifactory‚Äôs login method. OpenID-SSO has been enabled for authentication in production and is now available alongside the existing SAML SSO method. This transition is necessary as the Authentication team at T. Rowe Price will soon end support for SAML SSO. After [specific date], SAML SSO will be disabled for Artifactory access.

What You Need to Do: Please begin using OpenID-SSO to log into Artifactory at your earliest convenience. We highly recommend testing this method now to ensure seamless access after SAML SSO is disabled.

Reporting Issues: If you encounter any issues with OpenID-SSO, please submit a Jira ticket to the Developer Services Group for resolution. This will allow us to address any challenges prior to the final cutover.

Thank you for your attention to this transition. We appreciate your cooperation in making this a smooth change.

Best regards,
[Your Name/Department]
