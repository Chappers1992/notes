We are pleased to inform you that the migration of our SonarQube server to the new EKS-based infrastructure has been successfully completed. The service is now fully operational.

Key Points:

The SonarQube server is now running on the new EKS environment.
If your GitLab pipeline failed during the migration window, rerunning the pipeline should now result in a successful job.
Please monitor your pipelines and let us know if you encounter any issues or experience any unexpected behavior with SonarQube. Weâ€™ll be on standby to assist with any concerns.

Thank you again for your understanding and cooperation during this migration.
