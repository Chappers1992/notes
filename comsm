We are in the process of migrating our SonarQube server from the current EC2 instance to an EKS-based setup in order to improve scalability and performance. This change is planned to be seamless, but there will be a brief window of downtime during the switch.

Migration Details:

Date/Time of Migration: [Insert Date and Time]
Expected Downtime: 30 minutes or less
Impact on GitLab Pipelines: Any GitLab pipelines running during the migration, particularly those involving SonarQube analysis, may fail during the downtime window. Once the migration is complete, rerunning the pipeline should result in a successful job.
If you encounter any pipeline issues post-migration, please let us know so we can investigate and ensure a smooth transition.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this process. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.

Thank you for your patience as we work to enhance our infrastructure.
