We wanted to provide a quick update regarding the SonarQube migration that is currently in progress. Unfortunately, we are encountering some unexpected issues during the migration process, which is causing a delay in restoring full functionality to the SonarQube server.

Impact:

SonarQube is currently unavailable.
GitLab pipelines running SonarQube analysis will fail during this period.
Please bear with us as we work to resolve the issue. We are actively investigating and will notify you as soon as the service is back online.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience. If you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.
